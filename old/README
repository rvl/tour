Bike Tour 2008

These are just dodgy scripts to deal with Bike Tour data such as GPS
tracklogs and photos.

Things that are done:
 * Conversion of multiple NMEA files from GPS into one GPX per day.
 * Calculation of statistics from the GPX file.
 * Creation of a KML file viewable in Google Maps, and some javascript
   code to display it.
 * Plotting of altitude graphs from GPS tracks.
 * Geotagging of photos.
 * Posting of skeleton blog entries to WordPress.

It is Makefile driven. New GPS tracklogs are dropped into the gps
directory, and new photos are dropped into the photos directory. The
file data.py defines the days of bike tour, and the start and finish
towns.
